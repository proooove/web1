    <h2>How secure are QR code?</h2>

    <p>
     QR code technology has no security flaws and cannot be hacked. <br>
     The security risks that we often associate with QR codes — phishing, hacking, or malware — don’t stem from QR code technology but from the final destination of each code. <br>
     Third parties could hack the web page, connect malicious software, or steal data — the same way they conduct email or text message scams.<br>
    Here are some ways third parties could compromise QR codes:<br>
    They may print posters or flyers with malicious QR codes and distribute them in public places. <br>
    These codes would redirect users who scan them to untrustworthy landing pages and prompt them to download malicious software that steals their private data.<br>
    Once a marketing campaign has ended, the original QR codes may still exist even though the destination address is no longer owned by the creator. <br>
    Third parties could purchase the site, repurpose the QR code link, and send users to a different landing page.<br>
    They could print stickers containing hostile, counterfeit QR codes and paste them over legitimate ones. <br>
    These codes could take users to phishing websites rather than the intended website or special offer page.<br>
    Once again, these potential “hacks” revolve around the nature of links as a communication intermediary.<br>
     Third parties could also conduct similar crimes if companies used, say, a URL shortener. The unique risk of QR codes is that they are only machine readable — users are unable to identify whether someone has manipulated a code without scanning it.<br>
