    <h2>What is QR?</h2> 
    <img src='qr.png'><br>
    <p>A <strong><u>QR code</u></strong> (abbreviated from Quick Response code) is a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) invented in 1994 by the Japanese automotive company Denso Wave.
        A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached.<br>
        In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application.<br>
         A QR code uses four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to store data efficiently; extensions may also be used.<br>
        The Quick Response system became popular outside the automotive industry due to its fast readability and greater storage capacity compared to standard UPC barcodes.<br>
        Applications include product tracking, item identification, time tracking, document management, and general marketing.<br>
        A QR code consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background, which can be read by an imaging device such as a camera,<br>
         and processed using Reedâ€“Solomon error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted.<br>
        The required data is then extracted from patterns that are present in both horizontal and vertical components of the image.</p>
