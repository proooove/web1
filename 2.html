    <p>
        The QR code, similar to a barcode, is an example of an information matrix. <br>
        However a significant difference in the two is that while a barcode only holds information nicely in the horizontal direction, a QR can do so vertically as well. <br>
        This is why QR codes are referred to as two-dimensional, because they carry information both vertically and horizontally. <br>
        Another direct result to this is greater potential to carry information in a smaller space. Compared to a barcode, it’s no competition at all.<br>
        What are some of the advantages? A QR code can carry up to some hundred times the amount of information a conventional barcode is capable of. <br>
        When comparing the display of both: a conventional barcode can take up to ten times the amount of printing space as a QR code carrying the same amount of information.<br>
        A QR code is capable of being read in 360 degrees, from any direction, thus eliminating any interference and negative effects from backgrounds.    <br>
        Also, the algorithm which is used to create QR codes will allow for an error margin (approx. 7-30%).<br>
        “So what?” you ask? Well, this doesn’t just help with scanning purposes in case the item or code in question is dirty or damaged.<br>
        Knowing this feature, you can alter the QR code symbol to include a logo, keyword, picture, etc. <br>
        This could help extraordinarily in the aesthetic appeal of the code, and thus customer/consumer response.<br>
        Or it could just help cater to your creative/fun side, if you wanted to make a QR code of your own.<br>
